# CNNMnist
Use the convolutional neural network to identify the hand-written numbers in Mnist dataset. Coding from scratch, only use numpy and some basic library.

Input: (28,28,1,M), one (3,3,1,8) convolutional layer, 2 2x2 average pooling layers, 3 dense layers [288, 128, 10]. The code is not optimized and slow, train on a small dataset to see how it works.
